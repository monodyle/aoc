# Advent of Code Solutions

Hello, this repository is my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle solution.

In 2020, I'm trying to learn new languages (Go, Rust,...). So I aim to have fun solving the coding puzzles and playing with some languages.

My major is not computer science so someone review these codes will say: "What the hell is this??" ðŸ¤£
